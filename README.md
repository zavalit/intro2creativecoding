## try it out 


### how to

All you need is just 

* install dependcies with `yarn` command

* and afterwards let it run with `yarn dev`

* open in browser http://localhost:8080/




### good to know

There are 2 slides you probably would like to play with:
- in `src/scripts/color.js` to play with the way the color in `1. Color Basics` slide has been rendered
- in `src/scripts/pattern.js` to experiment with pattern in `2. Iterative Patterns` slide

#### and just for convenience

If you want to work/hack on a specific slide, go to `src/scripts/navigation.js` and change the `active_slide` so you get this slide first, for example:
- for `1. Color Basic` slide `active_slide: 0` to `active_slide: 1`, 
- for `2. Iterative Patterns` set `active_slide: 2` 
- and so on.
